The aim of the game is for a player (or team of players) to complete a sequence of five tokens of their colour (or six tokens in a 3 or 4 player game), in either a connected line in a row, column or diagonal. The game play rules are simple, to decide who starts the game, each player rolls the two die and the player with the highest total starts.
Thereafter each player gets a turn in a clockwise order, until there is a winner.
On a player’s turn, they roll the die. The sum of the die indicate what the player can do:
1. If there are one or more cells with the same number as the sum of the die that are empty, the player must place one of their tokens in one of the corresponding cells.
2. If there are no empty cells with the same number as the sum of the die (including 2 and 12), then the player must replace an opponent’s token on one of these cells with their own token. If all the cells are occupied by the player’s (or team’s) tokens, then the player cannot place a token;
3. If a 2 or 12 is rolled, then in addition to #1 and #2 above, the player gets an extra turn;
4. If a 10 is rolled (called a defensive roll), then the player must remove one of their opponent’s tokens from the board, except those in the grey cells (2s and 12s);
5. If an 11 is rolled (called a wild roll), then the player must place one of their tokens in any empty cell on the board.
